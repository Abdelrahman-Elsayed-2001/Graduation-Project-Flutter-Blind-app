With advances in new technologies, mobile devices have grown in popularity to become one of the most common consumer devices.

Cell phones are very important part of modern life even to visually impaired and blind people, previously they needed to operate the phone keys manually by remembering the position of keys.

The application should contain functions such as messaging with friends, operations of contact (add and delete), analyzing userâ€™s speech with friends it should be able to precisely capture his emotions and feelings, 9 setting alarms and timers, making a chatbot to have a short conversation with the user, creating a dashboard about his condition and send it to the accompanying person, friends, and family, it should also be linked to a smart stick that is always with the user in a moderate or severe vision impairment or blindness, the smart stick contains cameras that detects objects surrounding the user such as water, pits, pavements, cars, people or any obstacle to warn him to avoid accidents by saying it out with a headphone that has been added onto the stick.
